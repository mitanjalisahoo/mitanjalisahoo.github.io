            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Guidance and education together are the boon for students to follow their dream career and become successful. Dream careers of students also become reality when they seek help of career guidance while having their school education. Career counselling program at secondary and higher secondary level provides a broad idea of the world of work. It supports students career aspiration in terms of enabling them to explore numerous career options and choose one dream career based on their ability and skills.  For attaining this purpose school curriculum need to include career content at higher secondary level. Because curriculum is the totality of scholastic and co-scholastic experiences gained by the students during the entire process of education. Integration of career content in school curriculum creates a platform for resolving career related issues and provides information related to career choices as well as career developmental tasks. Therefore, career counselling should be included in the school curriculum at higher secondary school stage. The present paper suggests different ways of blending career counselling in school curriculum.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Todayâ€™s world of rapid development in terms of knowledge, economy and automated labour market, students are experiencing uncertainty in deciding about career and planning their future. They must learn more about life skills and the world of work. While developing life skills for better livelihood and building successful career, we have to focus on the importance and the benefits of integrating career lessons in the school curriculum to help students develop the proper employability skills, interview skills & thinking skills as they are the most important building blocks for our future career. School curriculum nowadays needs more emphasis on developing such skills in students to strengthen their ability to meet the needs and demands of the present society and to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of world of work. They must be develop the ability to align their life and career decision with their age, developmental stage, and life goals involved in career development process through-out the career life span. For this purpose career counselling program must introduced at higher secondary school stage through integrating career content in the school curriculum with academic lessons. It must be focused on developing such abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that bridges the gap between school life and career life while taking into consideration the psychosocial competencies and interpersonal skills. Career counselling program must include training to build the capacity of students to make right career decisions and take actions that will enable them to cope with managing their conflicts related to career choices and lives in a healthy and productive manner resulting in positive impact on career life span as well as their lives. Lack of career guidance and counselling leads to increasing number of less skilled and unemployed professionals.</p>
