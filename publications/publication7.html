            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Multilingual classrooms are becoming more common around the globe
                due to mass migration of people and also because of global trade and
                commerce. Learners need to be multilingual in order to succeed
                transnationally as the world is becoming a global knowledge center.
                India is a linguistically diverse nation where multilingual classrooms
                are common. But generally, this multilingualism is limited to social
                conversations. Learners fail to acquire academic language proficiency
                in their second, third or any other additionallanguage. So, teachers
                should follow a language teaching approach which can motivate and
                help the learners in acquiring academic language proficiency in the
                second or third language. This paper suggests that content and language
                integrated learning (CLIL) is a viable language teaching approach
                which can be helpful in teaching second or any additional language in
                the Indian classroom. The paper explains the benefits of CLIL in
                language teaching and presents a sample lesson framed by the author to
                teach English language through Social Science content at the
                elementary school level. In the discussion part, the author explains that
                similar lessons can be framed in any language to teach both content and
                language. Thus, this approach will be helpful in promoting
                multilingualism in the Indian classrooms.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Globalisation, migration and various forms of virtual mobility has accelerated the process of multilingualism across
                the globe affecting the scenario of language education. Indian society is plurilingual in nature with twenty-two
                recognized languages as per the eighth schedule of the Indian Constitution. Multilingualism is interweaved in the
                social system of Indian society as a result of which the Indian educational system follows the ―Three language
                formula‖. According to Linguistic Diversity Index reported by UNESCO (2009), India is one of the most
                linguistically diverse nations in the world. The linguistic diversity creates a rich cultural resource which has its
                influence on the social, political, economic, and educational system of India. Now, let us have a look at the actual
                meaning of multilingualism.
                According to Li (2008), any individual who has the ability to communicate in more than one language can be termed
                as multilingual.European Commission (2007) states that, multilingualism is the ability to engage with more than one language on a daily basis. British Council(2019) puts forth that, a multilingual classroom is one where learners know
                and use two or more languages. It is also expected that learners will be learning two or more languages.
                The multilingual diversity brings both opportunities as well as challenges to the complex Indian education system
                (Lightfoot. et.al,2021). The new National Education Policy (MoE, 2020) has laid greater emphasis on the languages
                in education as compared to the previous policies. The policy also talks about the cognitive benefits of
                multilingualism to young learners and hence it recommends exposure to languages early on in life. It clearly
                advocates the need to promote multilingualism.As we all know that Indian classrooms are multilingual in nature,but
                most often, this remains limited to social conversations. Though Indian education system follows the Three
                Language Formula, it is noteworthy that learners do not exhibit equal proficiency in the second or third language as
                compared to first language taught at the school level. For meaningful participation in democratic, social, and
                economic system, oral and literacy skills are highly desirable in multiple languages (Cummins,
                &Hornberger,2008).Therefore, this paper aims to reflect on Content and Language Integrated Learning as a viable
                approach to promote multilingualism in the Indian classroom.</p>
