            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Current status of unemployment in India has created a challenging situation for policy makers and educationists as well as our government to figure out the factors behind it.  Misfit of suitable candidates in different degree courses as well as work front are playing a major role in creating this critical situation. There is lack of guidance and counselling programs at school level as well as at higher studies, which leads to drop outs and less deserving candidature in educational and occupational areas. To overcome these problems, we need to provide suitable courses to the suitable persons and suitable jobs to the suitable candidates and this will happen by preparing career mature persons. Career maturity can be developed through the process of career counselling and the process is lifelong. For this career counselling services need to be introduced in a mass level from the beginning of education i.e. at schooling stage. So, there is a dire need to reestablish the importance of career counselling services with new ideas and innovative practices in the present situation in India. </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>We are living in the difficult situation where we are facing health related issues, unemployment, poverty, poor quality of education etc. In the present situation guidance and counselling plays an important role in every aspects of life. Guidance and counselling is the assistance or help provided by a more experienced person to a less experienced person to solve certain major problems of the individual. National Vocational Guidance Association (NVGA) defined guidance as the process of helping a person to develop and accept an integrated and adequate picture of himself/herself and of his/her role in the world of work, to rest this concept against reality and to convert it into reality with satisfaction to himself and benefit to society. Guidance helps the individual in self-understanding and in self-direction. The terms guidance and counselling have been loosely or interchangeably used [1].  Guidance and Counselling solves the problems related to different aspects of life like educational, vocational, personal, health, psychological etc.</p>

            <p>The problem of unemployment is very pertinent in India. People are experiencing lack of job opportunities. Everyone is feeling anxious about the situation who are working from home or sitting at home without vocational work. Not only school students, college students are also facing psychological problems about their study as well as career. The evolving areas like academic success, career and vocational development, social and personal development, resolving psychological problems, counselling for the parents as well as teachers and staffs in schools in India. It has been also identified by Kodad and Kazi [2] in their study. According to them need of school counselling in India is very essential. Saha [3] also established the need of guidance and counselling as felt by both teachers and students in West Bengal. </p>
            
            <p>It is very difficult for the adolescents to choose suitable job or career for their future because they are confused and amazed at the same time by so many jobs and career options. One’s choice of career can make his/her future comfortable or stressful. For choosing a suitable career one should be mature enough for taking decision about his/her career.
