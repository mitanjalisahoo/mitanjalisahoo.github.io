            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the study was to describe the effective use of performance-based assessment in the science classrooms. Performance-based assessment has the potential to develop scientific skills in learners. Performance-based assessment focuses on assessing and developing the problem-solving skills, application of knowledge, critical thinking skills and meta-cognition of the learners while they perform different types of task. Performance based assessment in science develop different process skills in learners like observation, inferring, experimentation, classification, measuring and communication. These skills ultimately improve the achievement and learning of students in science. An attempt has been made in this paper to design a performance-based assessment in science at elementary school level. The study will be helpful for teachers and students in their teaching and learning science at the elementary level. </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Assessment is an essential tool that helps to know the progress of learners and the difficulties that hinders the growth of the learners. To understand the hindrances of learners' performance, teachers change their instructional strategy in the classroom. Science is a systematized body of knowledge, an attitude, and a process. It gained through the experience, observations, explanation, experimentation and different activities. The position paper on science teaching is endorsed by a vast amount of research on science education, promotes a hands-on or inquiry-based approach. This is widely acknowledged only on theoretical level and paper pencil test is used to assess the progress of students. Only a paper-pencil test is not a valid indicator for the development or growth of the learners' progress. These tests are easier to generalize but do not reflect the students' actual performance in their real life. In traditional assessment, students have limited choices and cannot acquire comprehensive skills. This approach is more theoretical and may not promote healthy learning and a comprehensive atmosphere in science learning. The science classroom provides freedom to students to interact and experiment with things. They get significant learning experience and enhance their science process skills, which is essential for imbibing the spirit of scientific literacy. But in science classroom there is lack of coordination between what students learn and what teachers asked them to present. The science syllabus may not be congruent with the assessment, focusing on facts and comprehension, whereas the science syllabus focuses on solving the problem and investigating (Okey, 1995). Therefore, in the present situation, there is a need to change the assessment process and techniques just as instructional strategy in the classroom so that learners can develop 21st-century skills and other higher-order thinking skills. Assessment should be done this way so that learners can monitor or observe their limitations and progress and try to cope with them. NEP-2020 also emphasizes that assessment focuses on the national and local level curricula with relevant higher-order thinking skills and application of knowledge in real-life situations rather than rote memorization. Therefore, School boards should undertake a shift or bring a change in the assessment pattern to other alternative assessments to meet the requirement of 21st-century skills. Therefore, there is a need to change the assessment process where the teacher only works as a facilitator. They must focus on knowing why, when, where and how to apply their knowledge in the problematic situation rather than knowing what and how. Learners’ critical reflection assists them in attaining and demonstrating adequate teaching proficiency (Kemp, Jefferson and clay 1991; Kemp 1992a). 
            Due to limitations of traditional teaching and learning, performance-based assessment in science has been advocated as a technique to support students in developing transferable and practical scientific skills. Additionally, it helps students to overcome their reluctance and gain knowledge and comprehension of the science epistemological field (Naah, et. al.2018)
