            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Animal science, as a branch of biology that studies animals, is a fascinating subject that requires 
                hands-on experience with live animals for better understanding. However, the use of live animals in 
                teaching became controversial due to ethical, legal, environmental and practical reasons leading to ban 
                on use of animals for education purpose in various countries. Various alternatives emerged to fill this 
                gap by replacing the use of animals in teaching of animal science courses. In this study, the alternatives 
                to the use of animals and their effectiveness in enhancing student’s learning in absence of live animals
                in animal science courses will be studied. Also, various issues and concerns related to use of alternatives 
                in the teaching of animal science courses in providing adequate replacement to the use of animals will 
                be examined. Our findings suggest that various alternatives are providing effective replacement to the
                use of live animals in teaching of animal science courses. Their effectiveness depends on several factors 
                such as their quality, engagement of student, their benefit over traditional dissection practices, mindset
                of the educators etc. Some issues and concerns identified in implementation of alternatives were the 
                lack of adequate alternatives according to course requirement, difficulty in procuring alternatives due 
                to their high cost and insufficient funding, teachers’ reluctance and awareness, limitations of 
                alternatives, technical/ technological issues faced during their implementation, difficulty faced by 
                teachers in locating suitable resources etc. There is requirement of proper funding and institutional 
                support to implement suitable alternatives and to increase awareness among teachers regarding the 
                availability of suitable and affordable alternatives by conducting meetings and workshops on alternative 
                approaches.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Animal science is a subject which conducts scientific study of animals. Teaching animal science
                courses has traditionally relied on the use of live animals to provide students with hands-on experience 
                and a deeper understanding of animal behavior and physiology. Live animals have been widely used in 
                animal science practicals in education field as far as time goes back. However, the use of live animals 
                in teaching has raised concerns about animal welfare, ethical considerations, environmental impact and 
                practical issues such as availability, cost, and safety of animals (Dewhurst & Kojic, 2011). One of the 
                major concerns associated with the use of live animals in teaching is their potential impact on animal 
                welfare. Animals being sentient beings deserve moral and ethical consideration from humans (Ladwig, 
                2023). They should not be used as means to a goal, and should not be unnecessarily exploited for human 
                gain. Picking animals from natural environment for education or research purpose may disrupt food
                web including that particular animal and due to interdependency of various animals on each other 
                (Calizza, Costantini & Rossi, 2015) may cause adverse impact on environment. Excessive use of few 
                varieties of animals for various human use may cause these animals or the animals dependent on these 
                animals for food to be endangered or extinct. Many animals are bred in laboratory for education and 
                research purpose which have its own moral and ethical dilemma. Animals bred in laboratory are not 
                kept in humane condition causing them stress. This stress is inevitable and is brought on by a variety of 
                factors, including imprisonment, transportation, restraint, noise and other processes involved in 
                handling of the animals, as well as the experimental methods used on the animals (Balcombe, Barnard 
                & Sandusky, 2004; Bailey, 2018). The use of live animals for teaching purpose can cause suffering, 
                stress, injury, lifelong harm or even death to the animals, and can also perpetuate the belief that animals 
                are disposable objects for human. It is also inhumane practice. The fact that laboratory animals undergo 
                considerable and recurrent stress is widely acknowledged (Bailey, 2018). Advancement in technology 
                has provided scope for humane education. Using digital alternatives have proved to have equal or more 
                effectiveness than live animals and allow students to repeat the virtual dissection with no additional 
                instructional cost (Lalley et al., 2010) or harm to animals. Animal ethics is equally important as the 
                human welfare. 
                Due to these concerns, many governments around the world have banned the use of live animals 
                for the teaching purpose in various disciplines including the field of biological sciences. Now, the goal 
                of laboratory curricula is to foster in students a sense of responsibility for the welfare of animals as well 
                as an appreciation and respect for life (Pokale, 2019). Educators and students do not prefer hands-on 
                dissection due to variety of reasons like ethical, moral, and physiological reasons (Elmali, 2022). Only 
                researchers are allowed to use animals in scientific researches but only if they follow stipulated ethical 
                protocols regarding the use of animals for study purpose. Currently, all over the developed world, 
                ethical regulations are in the place to govern the use of animals in education and research. Due to these 
                reasons, many alternative approaches emerged to replace the use of live animals in teaching of Animal 
                Science courses and to improve the quality of science education (Pokale, 2017). Some of these 
                alternatives are plastic modals, videos, preserved specimen etc. while other advanced alternatives
                include use of computer-based alternatives. We are now at a point where we can evaluate a wide range 
                of alternatives to using animals in education and training due to the growth of technology (Cheluvappa,
                Scowen & Eri, 2017). However, their effectiveness in enhancing student learning of animal science and 
                their potential impact on animal welfare are not well understood. In this paper, the different alternative 
                approaches in the teaching of animal science without live animals has been studied. 
                The aim of this research paper is to study the alternatives to the use of animals in teaching of Animal 
                Science courses. Following are the main objectives of this study: 
                a) To study about the alternatives to the use of animals in teaching of animal science courses. 
                b) To study about the effectiveness of alternatives of animals in teaching of animal science 
                courses.
                c) To study the issues and concerns of the alternatives of animals in teaching of animal science 
                courses.</p>
